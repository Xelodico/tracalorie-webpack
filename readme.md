# About

This is a simple calorie counter app built with vanilla JavaScript and bundled using Webpack. It tracks your meals and workouts, calculating the total calories consumed and burned.

This project is part of Brad Traversy's [**Modern JS From The Beginning 2.0**](https://www.traversymedia.com/modern-javascript-2-0) course. I highly recommend it!

All of the JavaScript code I've written is located in the `src` folder.
